Good idea. This kind of app only works if the categories are **simple, intuitive, and stable over time**. Too many categories kills adoption.

Below is a **clean, practical category system** you can start with and scale later.

---

## ✅ Core Categories (MVP – strongly recommended)

These cover **95% of personal money flow**.

### 💰 Income

* Salary (primary)
* Bonus / Commission
* Side income / Freelance
* Other income

---

### 🏠 Fixed Bills (non-negotiable)

* Rent / Mortgage
* Utilities (electricity, water, gas)
* Internet / Mobile
* Insurance (health, car, home)
* Subscriptions (Netflix, Spotify, etc.)

👉 Reason: These are predictable and recurring.

---

### 🍽️ Food

* Groceries
* Eating out
* Coffee / snacks

👉 Keep food as **one category** with sub-tags if needed.

---

### 🚗 Transport

* Fuel
* Public transport
* Car loan
* Parking / tolls
* Maintenance

---

### 🧾 Living / Personal

* Phone purchases
* Clothing
* Haircuts / grooming
* Personal care

---

### 🎉 Lifestyle

* Entertainment
* Hobbies
* Games
* Events

---

### ✈️ Travel

* Flights
* Accommodation
* Activities

(Important: travel should NOT mix with lifestyle.)

---

### 🏥 Health

* Doctor
* Medication
* Gym / fitness
* Therapy

---

### 💳 Debt & Obligations

* Credit card payments
* Personal loans
* Student loans

---

### 💾 Savings & Investing

* Emergency fund
* Savings
* Investments
* Super / retirement

👉 Treat savings as an **outflow**, not leftover money. This is key.

---

## ⭐ Optional (Power-User / Phase 2)

Only add these when users ask for them.

* 👶 Family / Kids
* 🐶 Pets
* 🎁 Gifts & Donations
* 💼 Business / Side Hustle Expenses
* 🧪 Misc / One-off

---

## 🔑 Very Important Design Principle (do NOT skip)

**Money Flow =**

```
Income
– Fixed Bills
– Variable Spending
– Savings
= Remaining
```

Do **NOT** treat “Remaining” as a category.
It is a **computed result**.

---

## 📱 Suggested UX Structure (PWA-friendly)

**Top level tabs:**

* Overview
* Add Transaction
* History
* Categories
* Insights (later)

**Monthly view:**

* Total income
* Total spent
* Total saved
* Remaining balance

---

## 🚫 Common Mistakes to Avoid

* ❌ Too many categories early
* ❌ Mixing savings with leftover money
* ❌ Forcing users to over-categorize
* ❌ Making categories editable before MVP (allow later)

---

## My blunt recommendation for you

Start with **10–12 categories max**.
Add sub-categories later.
Make category selection **fast**, not “perfect”.

If you want, next I can:

* Design the **DB schema**
* Define the **monthly rollover logic**
* Help you decide **what NOT to track** (this matters more than what you track)
* Design a **killer “Remaining” screen** that actually changes behavior

Just tell me which one you want next.
